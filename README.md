# About

October-fied implementation of [GNU Terry Pratchett](http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/).

> "A man is not dead while his name is still spoken." - Going Postal, Chapter 4 prologue

In Pratchett’s “Going Postal”, workers who die in the line of duty have their names transmitted up and down the Discworld’s telegraph system as a tribute.

This plugin makes it easy for OctoberCMS users to do the same for Terry Pratchett, without having to modify their server configuration.
